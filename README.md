# Iris Data Mining

This notebook is a simple example of how to use the [Iris Data Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to train a model using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

The Iris Data Set is a classic data set used for machine learning. It contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

The attributes are:
- sepal length in cm
- sepal width in cm
- petal length in cm
- petal width in cm
  
The classes are:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolour
- Iris Virginica
  
The data set is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).
